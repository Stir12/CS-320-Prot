To ensure that code, programs, or software are functional and secure, I prioritize a multi-faceted approach. Thorough testing, including unit tests with frameworks like JUnit, helps validate functionality and detect bugs early on. Simultaneously, I incorporate security best practices such as input validation, encryption, and secure data handling to fortify against vulnerabilities. Effective communication and empathy are essential in interpreting user needs, achieved through techniques like user interviews and usability testing to ensure the program aligns with user expectations. In designing software, I emphasize understanding the problem domain, conceptualizing architecture, and breaking it into manageable components, all while adhering to design principles and iterating based on feedback to maintain scalability and flexibility.
